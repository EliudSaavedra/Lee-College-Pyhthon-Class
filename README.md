what the prject does is create a function called find_next_empty(puzzle) the funtion is filled with a puzzle. If the puzzle has empty spaces it is filled with -1 and return the rows and columns of the puzzle with -1 filling the empty spaces otherwise it will return None if the spaces are filled. The next function they add is the is_valid(puzzle, guess, row, col) function. The function figures out where the guess at the row and column of the puzzle is a valid guess. Then another function is used called solve_sudoku(puzzle) and what this function does is solve sudoku using back tracking.
